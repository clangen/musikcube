/*
 *  Optimal huffman decoding for AAC taken from:
 *  "SELECTING AN OPTIMAL HUFFMAN DECODER FOR AAC" by
 *  VLADIMIR Z. MESAROVIC , RAGHUNATH RAO, MIROSLAV V. DOKIC, and SACHIN DEO
 *  AES paper 5436
 *
 *   2 methods are used for huffman decoding:
 *   - binary search
 *   - 2-step table lookup
 *
 *   The choice of the "optimal" method is based on the fact that if the
 *   memory size for the Two-step is exorbitantly high then the decision
 *   is Binary search for that codebook. However, for marginally more memory
 *   size, if Twostep outperforms even the best case of Binary then the
 *   decision is Two-step for that codebook.
 *
 *   The following methods are used for the different tables.
 *   codebook   "optimal" method
 *    HCB_1      2-Step
 *    HCB_2      2-Step
 *    HCB_3      Binary
 *    HCB_4      2-Step
 *    HCB_5      Binary
 *    HCB_6      2-Step
 *    HCB_7      Binary
 *    HCB_8      2-Step
 *    HCB_9      Binary
 *    HCB_10     2-Step
 *    HCB_11     2-Step
 *    HCB_SF     Binary
